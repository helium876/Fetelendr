# Project: Google Sheets API and Calendar Frontend with Next.js

This project involves creating a backend API to fetch data from a public Google Sheets document and a frontend that displays this data in a beautiful calendar layout using Next.js.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your computer.
2. Confirm the Google Sheets document is publicly accessible via a shareable link.
3. Familiarize yourself with Next.js and basic JavaScript/TypeScript.

---

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Environment

1. Create a new project folder for your application.
2. Initialize a Next.js application within the folder.
3. Configure the project to use Tailwind CSS for styling.
4. Install any necessary dependencies, such as libraries for fetching data and displaying a calendar.

## Step 2: Fetch Data from Google Sheets

1. Identify the Google Sheets document you will use and note its unique Sheet ID.
2. Obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console with access to Google Sheets API.
3. Create an API endpoint in your application that uses the Google Sheets API to fetch the data from the document.
4. Structure the fetched data to match the headers: `Fete`, `Date`, `Pricing`, `Location`, `Type`, and `Details`.

## Step 3: Create the Calendar Frontend

1. Design a component that visually represents a calendar.
2. Ensure the calendar can display events on their corresponding dates.
3. Make the interface interactive, allowing users to click on a date to view detailed information about events.
4. Style the calendar to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

---

## Step 4: Integrate the API with the Frontend

1. Connect the frontend calendar component to the API endpoint created earlier.
2. Display the events dynamically on the calendar using the data fetched from Google Sheets.
3. Include error handling to manage issues such as network failures or API errors.

---

## Step 5: Test and Refine the Application

1. Test the API endpoint to ensure data is fetched correctly.
2. Verify that all events appear on the calendar as intended.
3. Make adjustments to the design and functionality to improve user experience.
4. Optimize the application for performance and usability.

---

## Optional Enhancements

1. Add filters to sort or categorize events based on criteria like type or pricing.
2. Include a search feature to find specific events quickly.
3. Add an option to export the calendar as a file or integrate with third-party calendar services.
4. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve loading times.

This set of instructions provides a structured approach to building a Next.js application that integrates data from a public Google Sheets document into a visually appealing and functional calendar frontend.
